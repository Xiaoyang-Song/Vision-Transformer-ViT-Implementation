# Vision-Transformer-(ViT)-Implementation

Implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT)

Xiaoyang Song and Han Liu's projects about the NAIVE re-implementation of the Vision Transformer architecture. The computational library that is used is Pytorch. At this moment (Feb 2022), basic re-implementation and ablation studies are done; but we are still working on refining our codes and plan to finish implementing all possible aspects of the ViT in the future.
